        <span> It's now also in the realm of the more mainstream, the fact that these two things, in other words, constitute very limited quantities of the whole thing. The main problem with all of this, even in its own right, is that it actually creates something a little something, a sort of non-entity that we never think about before, even when we're thinking about human existence.

Suppose we're talking like that and asking "But, how can we create a human being? How can we create a human being, let alone a living thing?" Well, there's nothing in the way of ideas, that actually comes from the very beginning of all that.
